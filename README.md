# Refactoring a JavaScript video store

The simple example of calculating and formatting a bill for a video store. If done in modern JavaScript, there are several directions you could take the refactoring. 

I explore four here: 
* refactoring to top level functions 
* to a nested function with a dispatcher 
* using classes
* transformation using an intermediate data structure
